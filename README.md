In this project, I developed a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using machine learning techniques to classify network traffic as either normal or various types of attacks. The NSL-KDD dataset was used as the benchmark dataset for training and testing the model.

The system was designed to:

Preprocess large-scale network traffic data.

Handle categorical and numerical features efficiently.

Train a robust Random Forest Classifier to detect anomalies.

Accurately predict attack categories on unseen test data.

Visualize model performance using confusion matrix and key evaluation metrics.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Handling Missing Values, Encoding Categorical Features, Feature Scaling)

Attack Category Mapping (e.g. DoS, Probe, U2R, R2L)

Model Training using Random Forest Classifier

Test Dataset Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

Visual Performance Representation using Confusion Matrix

Encoder and Scaler Reusability for Future Predictions

ðŸ’» Tech Stack:
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Google Colab

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
To build an efficient and scalable system that can help in the early detection of cyber-attacks and improve the security posture of network environments.
